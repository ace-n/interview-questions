# Ace's interview questions
These are the _conceptual_ "flashcard" questions (and answers) I use to prepare for software engineering interviews.

These questions are intended to cover the conceptual background you'll need to succeed. They are _not_ a replacement for **solving practice problems** or **implementing basic algorithms** (e.g. sorting algorithms, binary search) yourself.

> **Mid/Senior-level folks:** I recommend taking a look at Donne Martin's excellent [System Design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer). The `Cloud` questions cover **my** knowledge gaps relative to that tutorial. _(Your knowledge gaps will almost certainly be different than mine - feel free to send a pull request with your own questions for things I didn't cover.)_

## How I prepare for interviews
_Caveat: most of this advice is geared towards junior/"new grad" interviews. More senior folks may still find it useful, however._

### Part 1: conceptual questions
1. Attempt to answer these questions from memory
2. Review the answers I missed (usually via a script that records [in]correct answers)
3. `GOTO 1` until I get every question right _more times than I've gotten it wrong_

### Part 2: practice questions
1. Look at [Glassdoor](https://glassdoor.com) or similar sites for interview questions asked by a _particular company_ for a _particular role_.
2. Try to find trends in the questions - types, difficulty, concepts, etc.
3. Attempt to answer representative-sample questions (from Glassdoor or other sites) before checking the (provided) answers
4. Check the provided answers, and compare them to mine
5. `GOTO 3` until I feel _comfortable_ and _confident_ with a particular company's question level
6. `GOTO 1` for every different company I'm interviewing with

_You can also do step 4 [in groups](http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/30/the-protege-effect/)._

### Part 3: a few days before the interview
1. Go over some common algorithms and implement them yourself:
- Sorts (quicksort, mergesort, insertion sort)
- Binary tree traversals (insertion, deletion, search)
- Balanced binary tree (e.g. AVL tree) operations (insertion, deletion, search)
2. Test them against common edge cases
3. Tweak your implememtations until all your test cases pass
4. Do any other last-minute prep (e.g. reading company engineering blogs) **now**.

### Part 3: the night before the interview
1. _Do not prep any further._ (Ideally, you're fully prepared by this point anyway.)
2. Do something _fun and relaxing_ to calm your nerves.
3. Get a good dinner and a good night's sleep.

### Part 4: the day of the interview
1. Have a solid breakfast.
2. Remember that [stupid rejections happen to everyone](https://rejected.us/).
3. Good luck! You'll do great. :)
