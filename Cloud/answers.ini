[architecture_patterns]
1A=helper services send requests on behalf of someone else; common settings can be abstracted away
2A=proxy requests between a legacy and a modern system
3A=create separate backends for each frontend (to prefer customizability over reuse)
4A=load-balance requests between a legacy and a modern system, and gradually move requests over to the modern system
5A=command-query responsibility segregation; use separate data stores for reads and writes
6A=allow others to rewrite data, but reject outstanding transactions if they do
7A=a transaction-like set of actions that uses retry logic instead of locking
7B=a set of actions that are executed (or rolled back) as a unit, without any kind of locking in between
8A=Standard transactions are ACID compliant, sagas are not
9A=compensable, pivot, retryable
10A=a transaction that can be reversed
11A=if the pivot transaction is completed, the remaining transactions in the saga must also be completed

1A=Designing software so that it matches the business' needs
